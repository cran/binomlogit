Description: The R package contains different MCMC schemes to estimate the regression coefficients of a binomial (or binary) logit model within a Bayesian framework: a data-augmented independence MH-sampler, an auxiliary mixture sampler and a hybrid auxiliary mixture (HAM) sampler. All sampling procedures are based on algorithms using data augmentation, where the regression coefficients are estimated by rewriting the logit model as a latent variable model called difference random utility model (dRUM).
